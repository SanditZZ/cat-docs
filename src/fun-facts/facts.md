# Fun Facts

Here are some intriguing and fun facts about our feline friends:

## 1. Purring Mechanism
Cats purr at a frequency of 25 to 150 Hertz, which is known to have therapeutic effects on their muscles and bones.

## 2. Unique Whiskers
A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as its body, helping it gauge whether it can fit through tight spaces.

## 3. Vocal Variety
Cats can make over 100 different sounds, while dogs can only make about 10. Each sound can convey different emotions!

## 4. Sleep Champions
Cats sleep for about 13 to 16 hours a day, making them one of the sleepiest animals. This is to conserve energy for hunting.

## 5. Ancient Companions
Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East, primarily for their ability to control rodent populations.

## 6. Righting Reflex
Kittens develop a "righting reflex" that allows them to twist their bodies in mid-air to land on their feet if they fall.

## 7. Color Vision
Cats are not completely colorblind, but they see fewer colors than humans. They can distinguish blues and greens, but reds and pinks may appear more gray.

## 8. Social Grooming
Cats engage in social grooming, known as allogrooming, to strengthen bonds and reduce stress among their feline friends.

## 9. Cat Communication
Cats communicate with their tails: a straight-up tail indicates happiness, while a puffed-up tail signals fear or aggression.

## 10. Lifespan
Indoor cats typically live longer than outdoor cats, with an average lifespan of 12-15 years, but many can live into their 20s!
